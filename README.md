## The Idea
This project ist for a small guitar amplifier controlled with a small 8-bit microcontroller. The Amplifier and effect circuits are analoge, but all potentiometers are replaced by digital potentiometers, which are controlled by the MCU.
The circuits are a mixture of some of the circuits of https://www.electrosmash.com/ 

## What's needed?
* I2C Driver for the Potentiometer
* Digital Potiometer control
* Virtual Potentiometers
* Rotary Encoder evaluation
* LED control
* Real-time scheduler
* User Control State Charts
